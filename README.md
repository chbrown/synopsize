## to-sql

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/to-sql.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/to-sql)

Node.js script to read an Excel spreadsheet into a PostgreSQL database.

    $ npm install -g to-sql

Example:

    $ to-sql MySpreadsheet.xlsx
    Creating database MySpreadsheet
    Creating table Sheet1
    Inserting 171 rows
    Creating table Sheet2
    Inserting 0 rows

Uses the fabulous [`xlsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx) library for parsing the Excel spreadsheet.

It does some simple regular expression-based type inference, automatically distinguishing between `TEXT`, `INTEGER`, and `REAL`, as well as some formats of `DATE` and `TIME`.


### To-do

* Support more types in the type inference part
* Infer foreign relationships if possible
